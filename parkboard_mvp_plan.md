  - Dashboard with tab navigation
  - Booking creation with time/slot selection
  - Booking management (view, cancel)
  - Admin panel for oversight

### Key Components Implemented
- [x] `AuthWrapper.tsx` - Authentication provider and session management
- [x] `UserDashboard.tsx` - Main resident interface with tab navigation
- [x] `BookingForm.tsx` - New booking creation with validation
- [x] `SlotGrid.tsx` - Available slots display with real-time updates
- [x] `TimeRangePicker.tsx` - Date/time selection component
- [x] `UserBookingsList.tsx` - Active booking management
- [x] `AdminDashboard.tsx` - Administrative oversight
- [x] `Navigation.tsx` - App navigation with role-based routing

## üèóÔ∏è CURRENT ARCHITECTURE STRENGTHS

### What's Working Well
1. **Scalable Database Design**: Schema v2 supports future features without major changes
2. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation reduces runtime errors
3. **Security**: RLS policies protect user data with proper access control
4. **User Experience**: Intuitive booking flow with real-time availability
5. **Admin Capabilities**: Complete oversight without complexity
6. **Development Workflow**: Well-documented with testing utilities

### Technical Debt Items
1. **API Route Organization**: Could benefit from middleware for common operations
2. **Client-side State Management**: Consider React Query/SWR for better caching
3. **Error Boundaries**: Need better error handling for production edge cases
4. **Test Coverage**: Unit and integration tests for critical booking logic
5. **Bundle Optimization**: Code splitting for better initial load times

## üéØ LESSONS LEARNED & BEST PRACTICES

### What Worked
- **MVP-focused development**: Staying focused on core booking workflow
- **TypeScript adoption**: Caught many errors before runtime
- **Component architecture**: Reusable components reduced development time
- **Database-first design**: Strong schema foundation enabled rapid frontend development
- **Real-time testing**: Seed data and curl scripts accelerated debugging

### Areas for Improvement
- **Earlier user testing**: Should have tested with real users sooner
- **Performance considerations**: Could have optimized database queries earlier
- **Mobile-first design**: Should have started with mobile constraints
- **Documentation**: Could have maintained better development logs
