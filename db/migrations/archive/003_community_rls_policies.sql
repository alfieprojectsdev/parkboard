-- ============================================================================
-- TESTING QUERIES
-- ============================================================================

-- Test 1: Set community context
SELECT set_community_context('LMR');
SELECT get_community_context();
-- Expected: 'LMR'

-- Test 2: Verify slot filtering by community
SELECT set_community_context('LMR');
SELECT COUNT(*) as lmr_slots FROM parking_slots;
-- Should return only LMR slots

-- Test 3: Verify user filtering by community
SELECT set_community_context('LMR');
SELECT COUNT(*) as lmr_users FROM user_profiles;
-- Should return only LMR users

-- Test 4: Try to read another community's data (should return 0)
SELECT set_community_context('SRP');
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM parking_slots;
-- Should return 0 (no SRP slots exist yet)

-- Test 5: Verify bookings inherit community isolation
SELECT set_community_context('LMR');
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM bookings b
JOIN parking_slots s ON b.slot_id = s.slot_id;
-- Should only show LMR bookings

-- Test 6: List all policies
SELECT
  schemaname,
  tablename,
  policyname,
  permissive,
  roles,
  cmd,
  qual,
  with_check
FROM pg_policies
WHERE tablename IN ('parking_slots', 'user_profiles', 'bookings', 'communities')

/*
Expected Results:
  ✅ set_community_context() function created
  ✅ get_community_context() function created
  ✅ parking_slots has 4 community-aware policies
  ✅ user_profiles has 2 community-aware policies
  ✅ bookings has 3 policies (community via slot join)
  ✅ communities has 1 public read policy
  ✅ Data isolation working (queries filtered by community_code)
  ✅ No cross-community data leakage possible
*/

-- ============================================================================
-- SECURITY NOTES
-- ============================================================================
/*
1. Community Context MUST be set by app on every request
   - Done in app/[community]/layout.tsx
   - Ensures all queries are community-scoped

2. Bookings inherit community from parking_slots
   - No community_code column needed on bookings
   - Foreign key to parking_slots enforces isolation

3. Users cannot change their community_code
   - Update policy prevents community_code modification
   - Migration to new community requires admin intervention

4. RLS policies are additive (all must pass)
   - User must be authenticated (auth.uid())
   - AND must be in correct community
   - AND must meet specific conditions (owner, renter, etc.)
