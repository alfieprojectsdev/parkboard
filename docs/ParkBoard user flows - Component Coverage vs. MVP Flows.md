### Analysis: Component Coverage vs. MVP Flows

#### **Resident (Renter) Flows**

1. **Sign up / login**
   - `AuthWrapper.js`  
     → Handles login, session, and user context.
   - **Coverage:** ✅

2. **See list of currently available slots**
   - SlotGrid.js  
     → Displays available slots, filters by time/status.
   - **Coverage:** ✅

3. **Pick date/time → book slot**
   - `TimeRangePicker.js`  
     → Selects date/time.
   - BookingForm.js  
     → Combines time picker and slot grid, submits booking.
   - `BookingConfirmation.js`  
     → Shows confirmation after booking.
   - **Coverage:** ✅

4. **Cancel upcoming booking**
   - `UserBookingsList.js`  
     → Lists bookings, provides cancel button.
   - **Coverage:** ✅

5. **View booking history**
   - `UserBookingsList.js`  
     → Lists current and past bookings.

#### **Slot Owner (Admin for their slot) Flows**

1. **Login**
   - `AuthWrapper.js`  
     → Handles login/session for all roles.
   - **Coverage:** ✅

2. **Add basic slot info (slot number + description)**
   - AdminDashboard.js  
     → Slot management tab, can add/edit slot info.
   - **Coverage:** ✅

3. **Mark slot as “available” or “maintenance”**
   - AdminDashboard.js

   - AdminDashboard.js  
     → Tabs for slots and bookings, read-only by default.
   - **Coverage:** ✅

---

### **Outcome**

- **All MVP flows are covered by the canonical components in components.**
- No missing flows for resident, slot owner, or HOA admin.
- All user actions (login, booking, cancel, slot management, viewing history) are supported by the current component set.

**If you need a mapping of which component handles which UI/UX step, or want to see code-level entry points for each flow, let me know! Otherwise, you are fully covered for MVP.**
