## 🧪 Testing Status

**Landing Page Tests:**
```
✓ renders tagline (1/4 passing)
✗ renders heading (needs update - multiple "ParkBoard" found)
✗ renders CTA buttons (needs update)
✗ renders auth links (needs update)
```

**Why tests are failing:**
- Tests need updating to match new structure
- Multiple "ParkBoard" instances (nav + footer)
- Button/link selectors need refinement

**Action Required:**
- Update test selectors in `__tests__/routes/landing.test.tsx`
- Tests were written for old boilerplate, need to match new design

**Other Tests:**
```
✓ Price calculation tests (5/5 passing)
✓ Navigation component tests (3/3 passing)
⚠ AuthWrapper tests (needs mock improvements)
```
