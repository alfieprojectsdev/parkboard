I have an existing web app called ParkBoard. Here is a reference UI/UX design generated by v0.app, located under `docs/v0-ui-output`. It includes a full folder structure with HTML/JSX/CSS for screens like:

- Landing / /slots
- Slot listing and booking
- Owner listing flow
- Responsive layouts

Please review the reference design and my existing codebase, then:

1. Identify which components, layouts, or styling improvements from the v0 design can be applied to ParkBoard.
2. Suggest concrete file-by-file updates (e.g., which React components, CSS modules, or pages to modify).
3. Provide actionable code snippets where possible to implement these UI/UX improvements.
4. Keep the core ParkBoard functionality intact.
5. Highlight any conflicts or considerations, like naming collisions, CSS differences, or layout dependencies.

Output your suggestions as a **step-by-step plan** for updating ParkBoard with the improved design.
