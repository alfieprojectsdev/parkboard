# üöó ParkBoard MVP - Unified QA Checklist

This document consolidates **manual render checks** and **user flow tests** for the ParkBoard parking management system. Use it after major changes, before commits, and especially before pushing to production.

## üîç 1. Manual URL Render Check

Check each route in your browser. Ensure it loads without errors, renders correctly, and has no broken links or styling issues.

| URL | Expected Behavior | Key Components |
|-----|-------------------|----------------|
| `/` | Landing/Home page with community branding | `app/page.tsx`, `components/*` |
| `/auth` | Login/signup form (AuthWrapper) | `components/AuthWrapper.js` |
| `/slots` | SlotGrid shows available slots with TimeRangePicker | `components/SlotGrid.js`, `components/TimeRangePicker.js` |
| `/bookings` | User's active bookings list and history | `components/UserBookingsList.js` |
| `/bookings/new` | New booking form with slot selection | `components/BookingForm.js` |
| `/owner` | Slot owner management panel | `components/OwnerDashboard.js` |
| `/admin` | Admin dashboard with slots and bookings tabs | `components/AdminDashboard.js` |
| `/test` | Supabase connection test page | Test utilities |

- [ ] Consistent styling across all pages

---

## üîÑ 8. End-to-End Integration Tests

### Complete User Journey
- [ ] New user registration ‚Üí profile setup ‚Üí first booking ‚Üí cancellation
- [ ] Slot owner creates slot ‚Üí renter books it ‚Üí owner sees booking activity
- [ ] Admin monitors system activity across multiple users

## ‚ö° Quick Testing Notes

### Before Each Test Session
