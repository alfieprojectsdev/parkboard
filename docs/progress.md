### ✅ Current Status — ParkBoard MVP (as of 2025-09-13 23:14)

* **Auth**: Signup/Login/Logout works. `AuthWrapper` provides `user` + `profile` cleanly.
* **Booking flow**:

  * `SlotGrid` fetches slots and availability.
  * `BookingForm` now correctly posts `{ user_id, slot_id, start_time, end_time, status }` to `/api/bookings`.
  * API inserts booking and returns row. ✅
  * Confirmation screen shows, though slot label is still raw `id`.
* **Bugs fixed**:

  * “Missing required fields” → solved by aligning `slot_id` and `user_id`.
  * Supabase key / env issues → resolved.
  * Build error from stray comma → removed.
* **Pending polish**:

  * Pass `slot_number` / `slot_type` to confirmation so it shows `B-002 (uncovered)` instead of `Slot: 4`.
  * Remove React `key` warning in `SlotGrid`.
  * Handle “Done” → refresh bookings tab.
  * Add UI styling / loading indicators.

Perfect! The login page is now rendering properly. That brief flash you saw was likely your `AuthWrapper` component quickly checking authentication state and redirecting unauthenticated users to login - which is exactly what it should do.

## Current Status:
- Build errors: Fixed ✓
- Missing UI components: Fixed ✓ 
- Login page: Rendering ✓
- Auth redirect flow: Working ✓

## Next Test:
Try logging in with your Supabase credentials. This will test:
1. Whether the Supabase connection is working
2. If the auth flow redirects back to `/dashboard` properly
3. Whether the dashboard components render without errors

## What to Watch For:
When you submit the login form, you might encounter:
- Supabase authentication errors (if credentials are wrong)
- New component errors when it tries to render the dashboard
- More server/client component conflicts in the dashboard flow

## Quick Question:
Do you have valid Supabase user credentials to test with? If not, you might need to either:
1. Create a user through Supabase's auth UI first, or
2. Temporarily add a signup form

Try logging in and let me know what happens. We're systematically working through each layer of the application stack, and the authentication flow is the next critical piece to validate.

---

Testing with invalid credentials is actually a smart debugging approach - it will show us how error handling works and potentially reveal more issues.

But adding a signup form is probably more efficient for your development workflow. You have two quick options:

**Option 1: Test invalid login first (2 minutes)**
Try logging in with fake credentials like `test@example.com` / `password123`. This will test:
- Error handling in your `handleLogin` function
- Whether Supabase connection is working
- If error messages display properly

**Option 2: Add quick signup form (10 minutes)**
We can duplicate your login page and modify it for signup, or add signup functionality to the existing login page.

**Option 3: Create user via Supabase SQL (1 minute)**
Actually, there's a third option - you can create a test user directly in Supabase's SQL Editor:

```sql
-- In Supabase Dashboard > SQL Editor
INSERT INTO auth.users (
  instance_id,
  id,
  aud,
  role,
  email,
  encrypted_password,
  email_confirmed_at,
  created_at,
  updated_at,
  confirmation_token,
  email_change,
  email_change_token_new,
  recovery_token
) VALUES (
  '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000',
  gen_random_uuid(),
  'authenticated',
  'authenticated',
  'test@example.com',
  crypt('password123', gen_salt('bf')),
  NOW(),
  NOW(),
  NOW(),
  '',
  '',
  '',
  ''
);
```

Which approach appeals to you? Given your systematic debugging style, I'd lean toward testing the invalid login first to see what breaks, then we can decide on the signup approach.

---

Let's add signup functionality to your existing login page. Here's the modified version with a toggle between login and signup modes:Replace your existing `app/login/page.tsx` with this code.

**Key features added:**

1. **Toggle between Login/Signup** - Button at the bottom switches modes
2. **Password confirmation** - Only appears in signup mode
3. **Success message** - Shows when account is created successfully
4. **Form state management** - Clears fields when switching modes
5. **Better UX flow** - After successful signup, switches back to login mode

**Test it:**

1. Click "Don't have an account? Sign up" to switch to signup mode
2. Create a new account with email/password
3. After successful signup, it should switch back to login mode
4. Sign in with your new credentials

This should create the user in Supabase's auth system and then redirect you to `/dashboard` where we can continue debugging the next layer of issues.

---

The error indicates that your database trigger function `handle_new_user()` is trying to insert into a `public.users` table that doesn't exist. This is a common setup issue when working with Supabase auth.

Here's what's happening and how to fix it:

## The Problem
1. Supabase auth creates users in `auth.users` (built-in auth schema)
2. Your trigger function is trying to insert into `public.users` (your custom table)
3. The `public.users` table hasn't been created yet

## Solution

**Step 1: Create the public.users table**

In your Supabase SQL Editor, run:

```sql
-- Create the public.users table
CREATE TABLE public.users (
  id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE PRIMARY KEY,
  email TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
  -- Add any other fields you need
);

-- Enable Row Level Security
ALTER TABLE public.users ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create a policy (adjust as needed for your use case)
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own profile" 
ON public.users FOR SELECT 
USING (auth.uid() = id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update own profile" 
ON public.users FOR UPDATE 
USING (auth.uid() = id);
```

**Step 2: Create/verify the trigger function**

Make sure you have the trigger function set up:

```sql
-- Create the trigger function
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.handle_new_user()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO public.users (id, email)
  VALUES (NEW.id, NEW.email)
  ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

-- Create the trigger
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS on_auth_user_created ON auth.users;
CREATE TRIGGER on_auth_user_created
  AFTER INSERT ON auth.users
  FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION public.handle_new_user();
```

**Step 3: Test your signup**

Now try your NextJS signup function again. The trigger should automatically create a record in `public.users` whenever someone signs up through `auth.users`.

## Alternative Approach

If you prefer to handle this in your NextJS code instead of using a database trigger:

```javascript
// In your handleSignup function
const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signUp({
  email: email,
  password: password,
});

if (error) {
  console.error('Signup error:', error);
  return;
}

// If signup successful, create user profile
if (data.user) {
  const { error: profileError } = await supabase
    .from('users')
    .insert([
      {
        id: data.user.id,
        email: data.user.email,
      }
    ]);
    
  if (profileError) {
    console.error('Profile creation error:', profileError);
  }
}
```

The trigger approach is generally preferred as it ensures the `public.users` record is always created, even if users sign up through other methods (like OAuth providers).

---

Ah, I see! The issue is that your trigger function `handle_new_user()` is still trying to insert into `public.users`, but your actual table is called `user_profiles`. You need to update the trigger function to use the correct table name.

## Solution

**Step 1: Update the trigger function**

In your Supabase SQL Editor, update the function to insert into `user_profiles`:

```sql
-- Update the trigger function to use user_profiles table
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.handle_new_user()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO public.user_profiles (id, email, name, unit_number)
  VALUES (
    NEW.id, 
    NEW.email,
    COALESCE(NEW.raw_user_meta_data->>'name', 'New User'), -- fallback name
    'TBD' -- temporary unit_number since it's required
  )
  ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;
```

**Step 2: Handle required fields**

Since `name` and `unit_number` are NOT NULL but won't be available during auth signup, you have a few options:

**Option A: Make them nullable temporarily**
```sql
ALTER TABLE user_profiles 
ALTER COLUMN name DROP NOT NULL,
ALTER COLUMN unit_number DROP NOT NULL;

-- Then update the trigger:
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.handle_new_user()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO public.user_profiles (id, email)
  VALUES (NEW.id, NEW.email)
  ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;
```

**Option B: Collect additional info during signup**

In your NextJS signup, pass metadata:

```javascript
const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signUp({
  email: email,
  password: password,
  options: {
    data: {
      name: formData.name,
      unit_number: formData.unit_number,
      phone: formData.phone,
      vehicle_plate: formData.vehicle_plate
    }
  }
});
```

Then update the trigger to use this metadata:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.handle_new_user()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO public.user_profiles (
    id, 
    email, 
    name, 
    unit_number,
    phone,
    vehicle_plate
  )
  VALUES (
    NEW.id, 
    NEW.email,
    NEW.raw_user_meta_data->>'name',
    NEW.raw_user_meta_data->>'unit_number',
    NEW.raw_user_meta_data->>'phone',
    NEW.raw_user_meta_data->>'vehicle_plate'
  )
  ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;
```

**Option C: Skip the trigger and handle it in code**

Remove the trigger entirely and create the profile after signup:

```sql
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS on_auth_user_created ON auth.users;
```

Then in your NextJS code:

```javascript
// First, sign up the user
const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signUp({
  email: email,
  password: password,
});

if (error) {
  console.error('Signup error:', error);
  return;
}

// Then create the user profile
if (data.user) {
  const { error: profileError } = await supabase
    .from('user_profiles')
    .insert([
      {
        id: data.user.id,
        email: data.user.email,
        name: formData.name,
        unit_number: formData.unit_number,
        phone: formData.phone || null,
        vehicle_plate: formData.vehicle_plate || null,
      }
    ]);
    
  if (profileError) {
    console.error('Profile creation error:', profileError);
  }
}
```

I'd recommend **Option C** since you need to collect additional required fields anyway, and it gives you more control over the user creation process.

---

You should insert the profile creation code in the `handleSignup` function, right after the successful auth signup. Here's how to modify your code:Key changes I made:

1. **Added new state variables** for the additional profile fields:
   - `name`, `unitNumber`, `phone`, `vehiclePlate`

2. **Modified the `handleSignup` function**:
   - Added the profile creation code after successful auth signup
   - Added proper error handling for profile creation
   - Clear all form fields on successful signup

3. **Added new input fields** for signup mode:
   - Full Name (required)
   - Unit Number (required) 
   - Phone Number (optional)
   - Vehicle Plate (optional)

4. **Updated `toggleMode` function** to clear all the new fields when switching between login/signup modes

Now when a user signs up, it will:
1. Create the auth user in `auth.users`
2. Create the corresponding profile record in `user_profiles` 
3. Handle any profile creation errors gracefully

Make sure to remove any existing trigger first if you have one:

```sql
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS on_auth_user_created ON auth.users;
```

---

The issue is in your `AuthWrapper.js` - it's redirecting back to login even when the user is authenticated. The problem is in the `fetchProfile` effect logic. Here's what's happening:

1. User logs in successfully
2. `AuthWrapper` detects the user is authenticated
3. It tries to fetch the user profile from `user_profiles` table
4. If there's any error (like profile doesn't exist), it doesn't set the profile but also doesn't handle the missing profile case
5. The redirect logic `router.replace("/login")` runs in the `else` block when `user` is null, but the real issue is that the component might be getting stuck in the loading state or not handling profile fetch errors properly

Here's the updated `AuthWrapper.js`:Key changes made:

1. **Separated loading states**: Added `profileLoading` to distinguish between auth loading and profile loading
2. **Better error handling**: Profile fetch errors are logged but don't prevent the user from accessing the dashboard
3. **Fixed redirect logic**: Only redirect to login when we're sure there's no authenticated user (not during loading)
4. **Improved render logic**: Clear separation between auth loading, profile loading, and authenticated states

However, there's still a potential issue - if the user profile doesn't exist in your `user_profiles` table, this could cause problems. Let's also check if the profile was created properly during signup.

**To debug further, can you:**

1. Check your browser's Network tab to see if there are any failed API calls
2. Check the browser console for any error messages
3. Verify that a record was created in your `user_profiles` table after signup:

```sql
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor to check if profile exists
SELECT * FROM user_profiles WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';
```

If no profile exists, that means the profile creation during signup failed, and you'll need to either:
- Fix the signup process to ensure profile creation works
- Or create the profile manually for testing
- Or modify the AuthWrapper to handle missing profiles more gracefully (redirect to profile setup page)

Great! It sounds like the authentication is working now and you're seeing the actual dashboard. The `UserDashboard` component looks well-structured with proper loading states and profile guards.

Since you mentioned you're seeing "what looks like the actual dashboard page," I assume you're seeing the tab navigation (My Bookings / New Booking buttons) and the dashboard is rendering correctly.

A few things to verify the dashboard is working properly:

1. **Check the My Bookings tab** - This should show any existing bookings for the user via the `UserBookingsList` component
2. **Check the New Booking tab** - This should show the booking form via the `BookingForm` component

If you're seeing any issues or blank content in these tabs, the problem would likely be in the child components (`UserBookingsList` or `BookingForm`). 

**Quick debugging steps:**

1. **Open browser console** - Check for any JavaScript errors
2. **Check Network tab** - Look for any failed API requests when switching tabs
3. **Test both tabs** - Click between "My Bookings" and "New Booking" to see if both render properly

**Also, you might want to add some better visual feedback.** Here's a small enhancement to make the loading state more obvious:This enhanced version adds:

1. **Better loading spinner** with animation
2. **Welcome header** showing the user's name and unit number
3. **Improved tab styling** with better hover states and active indicators
4. **Card-based layout** with proper spacing and shadows
5. **Better error state** with helpful messaging

The key improvements make the dashboard feel more polished and provide better user feedback.

If everything looks good and both tabs are working, then your authentication flow is complete! The next step would be to ensure the child components (`UserBookingsList` and `BookingForm`) are working properly with your database schema.

---

Both components look well-structured! The main things that could cause issues are:

1. **Missing child components** (`TimeRangePicker`, `SlotGrid`)
2. **Missing API endpoint** (`/api/bookings`)
3. **Database table structure** mismatch

Let me help you debug step by step:

## Quick Debugging Steps:

1. **Check the browser console** when you click on each tab - any JavaScript errors?

2. **For the "My Bookings" tab**: Check if the query is working by running this in your Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
-- Replace 'your-user-id' with your actual user ID from user_profiles
SELECT b.*, ps.slot_number, ps.slot_type 
FROM bookings b
JOIN parking_slots ps ON b.slot_id = ps.slot_id
WHERE b.user_id = 'your-user-id' 
AND b.status = 'confirmed'
ORDER BY b.start_time;
```

3. **Check if you have the required tables**:
```sql
-- Check if tables exist
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name IN ('bookings', 'parking_slots');
```

## Potential Issues & Quick Fixes:

**Issue 1: Missing TimeRangePicker/SlotGrid components**
If these components don't exist, the "New Booking" tab will be blank. You can create a simple placeholder:**Issue 2: Missing API endpoint**
You'll also need to create the `/api/bookings` endpoint. Create `app/api/bookings/route.js`:## Next Steps:

1. **Create these components** if they don't exist
2. **Check your database schema** - make sure you have `bookings` and `parking_slots` tables
3. **Test the "New Booking" tab** - you should now see time pickers and slot grid
4. **Test the "My Bookings" tab** - should show any existing bookings

Can you tell me what you see when you click on each tab now? Also, let me know if you need help creating the database tables (`bookings`, `parking_slots`) if they don't exist yet.

Perfect! Much more manageable now - around 40KB of your actual project code instead of 126MB. Looking at your codebase, I can already spot several issues that are likely causing your console errors.

### Primary Issues I'm Seeing:

**1. Missing Import Statement in login/page.tsx:**
```typescript
// ❌ This line is missing the import
<Input
```
You're using `<Input>` component but there's no import for it. You have the commented import but it's not active.

**2. Mixed File Extensions (.js vs .tsx):**
Your components directory has inconsistent extensions:
- `AuthWrapper.js` - should be `.tsx` (uses TypeScript/JSX)
- `BookingForm.js` - should be `.tsx` 
- `Navigation.js` - should be `.tsx`
- etc.

**3. Server vs Client Component Conflicts:**
In your pages like `bookings/page.tsx` and `slots/page.tsx`, you're:
- Using `await supabase.auth.getSession()` (server-side)
- Then passing handlers like `handleCancel` and `handleBooking` (client-side)
- But these handlers use `window.location.reload()` (browser-only)

This creates a server/client boundary violation.

**4. Missing UI Component Implementations:**
Your `components/ui/button.tsx` and `components/ui/card.tsx` are empty files, but you're importing from them in `login/page.tsx`.

### Quick Diagnostic Questions:

1. **What specific error messages** are you seeing in your terminal when you run `npm run dev`?

2. **Are you getting browser console errors** or build-time errors?

3. **Did you install shadcn/ui** or are you expecting those UI components to work automatically?

The most critical fix will be addressing the server/client component architecture - you'll need to either make your pages fully client-side or restructure the data fetching. Which approach appeals to you more?

---

Same pattern - now it's the missing `<Button>` component. Your `components/ui/button.tsx` is also empty.

Let's create the Button component:Save this to `components/ui/button.tsx`.

This should resolve the Button component error. The pattern we're seeing is that your `login/page.tsx` was built expecting shadcn/ui components, but the component files were empty placeholders.

After saving the Button component, try the login page again. If it renders successfully, you can test the authentication flow by trying to log in with your Supabase credentials.

We're systematically working through each missing UI component that prevents the page from rendering.
