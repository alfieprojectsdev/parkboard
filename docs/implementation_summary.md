## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### **Step 1: Run Database Migration** (5 min)

```bash
# Copy 007_marketplace_model.sql to Supabase SQL Editor
# Run the entire script
# Verify tables created:
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_name IN ('slot_rental_settings', 'slot_earnings');
```

### **Step 2: Create All Page Files** (10 min)

```bash
# Create directories
mkdir -p app/onboarding
mkdir -p app/owner/setup app/owner/earnings app/owner/settings
mkdir -p app/owner/slots/[slotId]/edit
mkdir -p app/marketplace/[slotId]

# Copy artifact contents into each file:
# - app/onboarding/page.tsx
# - app/owner/setup/page.tsx
# - app/owner/page.tsx
# - app/owner/earnings/page.tsx
# - app/owner/settings/page.tsx
# - app/owner/slots/[slotId]/edit/page.tsx
# - app/marketplace/page.tsx
# - app/marketplace/[slotId]/page.tsx
# - app/dashboard/page.tsx (replace existing)
# - components/common/Navigation.tsx (replace existing)
```

### **Step 3: Update Signup Redirect** (2 min)

In your signup handler (likely `app/login/page.tsx`):

```typescript
// After successful signup, change:
router.push('/dashboard'); // ❌ Old

// To:
router.push('/onboarding'); // ✅ New
```

### **Step 4: Test the Flow** (15 min)

```bash
npm run dev
```

**Test as Owner:**
1. Sign up → Select "Yes, I own a slot"
2. Click "List my slot"
3. Fill form → Submit
4. View slot on owner dashboard
5. Toggle listing, edit details
6. Check earnings page

**Test as Renter:**
1. Sign up different account → Select "No, I'm a renter"
2. Browse marketplace
3. Click slot → View details
4. Book the slot
5. Check "My Bookings"

## 🐛 Common Issues & Fixes

### **Issue: "No slots available in marketplace"**
**Fix:** Check that slots have `is_listed_for_rent = true` and `status = 'available'`

```sql
UPDATE parking_slots 
SET is_listed_for_rent = true, status = 'available'
WHERE owner_id IS NOT NULL;
```

### **Issue: "Navigation doesn't show 'My Slots'"**
**Fix:** User needs to create a slot first. The link appears dynamically after listing.

### **Issue: "Booking fails with overlap error"**
**Fix:** This is correct behavior. Choose different dates or check existing bookings.

### **Issue: "Earnings not showing"**
**Fix:** Earnings are created when booking is made. Check `slot_earnings` table:

```sql
SELECT * FROM slot_earnings WHERE owner_id = 'your-user-id';
```

### **Issue: "Settings won't save"**
**Fix:** Ensure slot exists and user owns it:

```sql
SELECT * FROM parking_slots WHERE slot_id = X AND owner_id = 'your-user-id';
```

## 🎓 Architecture Highlights

### **Flexible for Different Models**

This implementation supports:

**Model A: Pure P2P (Your Current Setup)**
```
Resident → owns → Slot → rents to → Other Resident
```

**Model B: Admin-Managed**
```
Admin → manages → Pool of Slots → residents book
(Just set managed_by = 'admin')
```

**Model C: Hybrid**
```
Some slots owned, some admin-managed
(Works out of the box)
```

### **Extensible Design**

Easy to add:
- Multiple buildings (add `building_id` to slots)
- Subscription tiers (add `subscription_id` to profiles)
- Custom pricing rules (hourly/daily/weekly/monthly)
- Dynamic pricing (peak hours, holidays)
- Promotions & discounts
