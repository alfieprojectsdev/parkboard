If ever, ito yung planned community announcement/soft launch message (hopefully by Wed/Thurs): 

Hello po mga ka-LMR! 🅿️

Based on what I've observed here in the Viber GC (nakakalito na mag-scroll through hundreds of messages for available parking 😅), I pitched the idea to my brother to build something that might help!


LMR ParkBoard
✅ Browse all available slots in one place - no more scrolling!
✅ Post your slot (location, dates, contact) - simple form lang
✅ Filter by parking level (P1, P3, P6) and tower (East/North/West)
✅ Mark slots as TAKEN when booked
✅ Mobile-friendly

Currently working on:
- Real-time notifications when new slots posted (P6 NT available → instant alert!)
- Recurring availability (for regular renters, e.g., "available every weekday 8am-5pm")

Demo: [https://parkboard.app/LMR]
Screenshots: [INSERT SCREENSHOTS]

Your input needed: What would help you most?
- Priority notifications for your preferred location?
- Ability to "bookmark" favorite slot owners?
- Something else?

P.S. My younger brother built this in his free time to help our community. If it saves you hassle, paki-treat naman siya ng Jollibee or KFC para motivated mag-improve! 😅 Maya/PayPal lang. 

Also, during design phase, I suggested adding ad space to help cover platform costs (database, hosting, tools). Community first: LMR resident businesses get FREE ads during beta! If interested, just reach out. 🙏
