# 🧠 ParkBoard: Beyond MVP - Critical Architecture & Business Brainstorm
**Generated:** 2025-10-06 15:13:20

> "The best time to think about scale is before you need it. The worst time is when you're on fire."

This document challenges you to think **critically** about ParkBoard's future. Not just "what features to add" but **fundamental decisions** that will shape whether this becomes a sustainable business or a maintenance nightmare.

---

## 🏗️ Part 1: Current State - What Have We Built?

### The Good ✅

Your MVP has some **solid foundations**:

1. **Clean separation of concerns**
   - Auth layer (Supabase)
   - Data layer (PostgreSQL with RLS)
   - Presentation layer (Next.js + React)

2. **Security-first approach**
   - RLS policies on all tables
   - Separate client/server/admin Supabase instances
   - No sensitive data in browser

3. **Type safety**
   - TypeScript throughout
   - Database types mirror SQL schema
   - Type guards for validation

### The Concerning 🟡

But let's be honest about **technical debt** already accumulated:

1. **No middleware protection** (docs/authentication_*.md line 161-193)
   - Unauthenticated users can hit API routes directly
   - Client-side redirect only (can be bypassed)
   - **Question:** How long until someone exploits this?

2. **Email auto-confirmation** (signup/route.ts line 195)
   ```typescript
   email_confirm: true,  // Auto-confirm (can change later)
   ```
   - Anyone can register with any email
   - No email ownership verification
   - **Question:** What stops competitors from spam-registering?

3. **Manual transaction pattern** (signup/route.ts lines 173-305)
   - If profile creation fails, we manually delete auth user
   - What if the delete fails too? Orphaned auth records!
   - **Question:** How do you monitor for orphaned data?

4. **No rate limiting** (authentication_*.md line 215-245)
   - Brute force attacks possible
   - DDoS via signup endpoint
   - **Question:** How much will cloud costs spike under attack?

5. **Hardcoded business logic in client** (TODO docs)
   - Price calculation in browser
   - Availability checking client-side
   - **Question:** What happens when pricing rules change?

---

## 🎯 Part 2: The Uncomfortable Questions You Must Answer

### Question 1: Who Actually Owns This?

**Current state:** Single condo (Lumiere Residences)

**Scenario:** Another condo wants to use ParkBoard.

```
Condo A (Lumiere):           Condo B (New client):
- Slots A-01 to A-50          - Slots 101 to 150
- 100 residents               - 200 residents
- $50/hr pricing              - $30/hr pricing
```

**Critical decisions:**

1. **Data architecture:**
   - [ ] Single database, add `condo_id` to every table?
   - [ ] Separate database per condo?
   - [ ] Separate deployment per condo?

2. **Pricing model:**
   - [ ] Per condo subscription?
   - [ ] Per slot commission?
   - [ ] Per booking transaction fee?

3. **Branding:**
   - [ ] White-label (their logo, their domain)?
   - [ ] Shared platform (parkboard.com/lumiere)?
   - [ ] Hybrid (their domain → your backend)?

**Impact on current codebase:**

```typescript
// Option 1: Multi-tenant single database
interface UserProfile {
  id: string
  condo_id: string  // NEW - tenant isolation
  name: string
  // ... rest
}

// All queries need:
.eq('condo_id', currentCondo.id)

// All RLS policies need:
USING (condo_id = current_setting('app.current_condo')::uuid)
```

```typescript
// Option 2: Separate databases
// - Each condo gets their own Supabase project
// - Your app becomes a "deployment manager"
// - More isolated, more expensive, harder to manage

// app/api/[condoSlug]/...
// Different Supabase URL per tenant
const supabase = createClient(
  process.env[`SUPABASE_URL_${condoSlug.toUpperCase()}`],
  process.env[`SUPABASE_KEY_${condoSlug.toUpperCase()}`]
)
```

**⚡ ACTION ITEM:** Decide multi-tenancy strategy **NOW**.
Changing this later = complete rewrite.

---

### Question 2: What Happens When Money Gets Involved?

**Current state:** Free to use, no payments

**Inevitable future:** Someone wants to charge for bookings.

**Payment flow scenarios:**

#### Scenario A: Platform facilitates payment
```
Renter pays $100
├─ $85 → Slot owner (your platform fee: $15)
├─ $15 → Your platform
└─ Stripe fee: $3
   Net to owner: $82
```

**Implications:**
- Need payment processor (Stripe, PayPal)
- Need escrow logic (hold money until booking ends)
- Need payout system (weekly/monthly to owners)
- Need refund policy (cancellations)
- Need tax reporting (1099 forms in US)

#### Scenario B: Owners collect directly
```
Renter pays $100 → Owner directly
Your platform → Subscription fee from owner ($50/month)
```

**Implications:**
- No payment liability for you
- Less revenue potential
- Harder to enforce quality
- Owners might bypass your platform

**Database changes needed:**

```sql
-- Option A: Platform processes payments
CREATE TABLE transactions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  booking_id INT REFERENCES bookings(booking_id),
  stripe_payment_intent_id TEXT,
  amount_total DECIMAL(10,2),
  amount_to_owner DECIMAL(10,2),
  amount_platform_fee DECIMAL(10,2),
  amount_stripe_fee DECIMAL(10,2),
  status TEXT,  -- pending, succeeded, refunded
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE payouts (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  owner_id UUID REFERENCES user_profiles(id),
  amount DECIMAL(10,2),
  stripe_transfer_id TEXT,
  period_start DATE,
  period_end DATE,
  status TEXT,  -- pending, processing, completed, failed
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

```sql
-- Option B: Subscription model
CREATE TABLE condo_subscriptions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  condo_id UUID REFERENCES condos(id),
  plan TEXT,  -- basic, premium, enterprise
  stripe_subscription_id TEXT,
  status TEXT,  -- active, cancelled, past_due
  current_period_end TIMESTAMPTZ,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

**⚡ ACTION ITEM:** Choose payment model **before** adding features.
Payment architecture affects EVERYTHING.

---

### Question 3: What's Your Defensibility?

**Hard truth:** Your current MVP can be cloned in a weekend.

**What makes ParkBoard hard to replicate?**

#### Option 1: Network Effects
- More residents = more slots available
- More slots = more renters attracted
- Classic two-sided marketplace

**Problem:** Chicken-and-egg. How do you bootstrap?

#### Option 2: Data Moat
- Historical pricing data → Dynamic pricing algorithm
- User reputation scores → Trust and quality
- Booking patterns → Predictive availability

**Current schema gaps:**

```sql
-- Missing: User reputation
CREATE TABLE user_reviews (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  booking_id INT REFERENCES bookings(booking_id),
  reviewer_id UUID REFERENCES user_profiles(id),
  reviewee_id UUID REFERENCES user_profiles(id),
  rating INT CHECK (rating >= 1 AND rating <= 5),
  comment TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Missing: Dynamic pricing
CREATE TABLE pricing_rules (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  slot_id INT REFERENCES parking_slots(slot_id),
  day_of_week INT,  -- 0-6
  hour_start INT,   -- 0-23
  hour_end INT,
  price_multiplier DECIMAL(3,2),  -- 1.5x on weekends
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Missing: Demand analytics
CREATE TABLE availability_searches (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID,
  start_time TIMESTAMPTZ,
  end_time TIMESTAMPTZ,
  found_slots INT,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

#### Option 3: Integration Moat
- Direct integration with condo management systems
- Integration with parking access control (barrier gates)
- Integration with payment platforms

**API design needed:**

```typescript
// Webhook for gate control system
POST /api/webhooks/access-control
{
  "booking_id": 123,
  "vehicle_plate": "ABC1234",
  "entry_time": "2025-10-06T15:00:00Z",
  "exit_time": null,
  "status": "entered"
}

// Sync with condo management system
POST /api/integrations/condo-manager/sync
{
  "residents": [...],
  "parking_allocations": [...],
  "unit_changes": [...]
}
```

**⚡ ACTION ITEM:** Pick ONE moat strategy to build this quarter.
Can't do all three at once.

## 💰 Part 3: Business Model Deep Dive

### Current Revenue: $0/month 📉

Let's model some scenarios:

#### Model A: Transaction Fee (Marketplace)
```
Assumptions:
- 1 condo, 50 slots
- 30% utilization (15 bookings/day)
- Average booking: 4 hours @ $50/hr = $200
- Your fee: 10%

Monthly revenue:
15 bookings/day × 30 days = 450 bookings
450 × $200 × 10% = $9,000/month
```

**Unit economics:**
- Stripe fee: 2.9% + $0.30 = ~$6 per booking
- Your net per booking: $200 × 10% - $6 = $14
- Margin: 70%

**Scalability:**
- 10 condos = $90k/month 🎯
- 100 condos = $900k/month 🚀

**Risks:**
- What if condos demand lower fees?
- What if owners bypass your platform?
- What if Stripe increases fees?

#### Model B: SaaS Subscription
```
Pricing tiers:
- Basic:     $99/month  (up to 50 slots)
- Premium:   $299/month (up to 200 slots)
- Enterprise: $999/month (unlimited)

Assumptions:
- 60% on Basic, 30% Premium, 10% Enterprise
- 100 condos

Monthly revenue:
(60 × $99) + (30 × $299) + (10 × $999) = $24,600/month
```

**Unit economics:**
- Cost per customer: ~$50/month (hosting, support)
- Net per customer: ~$150/month (average)
- Margin: 75%

**Scalability:**
- More predictable revenue
- Lower upside per condo
- Easier to forecast

**Risks:**
- High churn in low-usage condos
- Hard to justify $299/month if only 5 bookings/month
- Enterprise sales are slow

#### Model C: Hybrid (Best of both?)
```
Base subscription: $49/month
+ Transaction fee: 5% per booking

For the same 1 condo scenario:
- Subscription: $49/month
- Transaction fees: 450 bookings × $200 × 5% = $4,500
- Total: $4,549/month

10 condos = $45,490/month
100 condos = $454,900/month
```

**Pros:**
- Steady base revenue (subscription)
- Upside from usage (transactions)
- Aligns incentives (you win when they win)

**Cons:**
- More complex to explain
- More complex to implement
- Might feel like "double-charging"

**⚡ ACTION ITEM:** Model YOUR target customer.
1 enterprise condo? Or 100 small condos? Changes everything.

## 🔮 Part 4: Feature Roadmap - But Which Features?

### The Trap: Building What Users Ask For

**User:** "Can you add a waitlist feature?"
**You:** "Sure!" → 2 weeks of dev time
**Reality:** 3 people use it once

### The Framework: Jobs To Be Done

Instead of "what features?", ask:

**What job are users hiring ParkBoard to do?**

#### Job #1: "I need parking NOW" (Renter)

**Current solution:** Browse available slots → Book
**Gaps:**
- What if no slots available right now?
- What if I'm a guest (no account)?
- What if I need parking regularly (same time every week)?

**Feature ideas (prioritized by impact):**

1. **Instant booking** (High impact)
   - "Book first available slot" button
   - No browsing, just click and park
   - Implementation: 1 week

2. **Guest booking** (Medium impact)
   - Resident shares booking link with guest
   - Guest pays, no account needed
   - Implementation: 2 weeks

3. **Recurring bookings** (High impact)
   - "Every Monday 9am-5pm"
   - Auto-creates bookings for 3 months
   - Implementation: 1 week

**ROI calculation:**
- Instant booking: 20% increase in bookings (users hate browsing)
- Guest booking: 50% increase in users (guests can book)
- Recurring: 30% increase in booking value (longer commitments)

#### Job #2: "I want passive income" (Owner)

**Current solution:** List slot → Wait for bookings → Get paid
**Gaps:**
- How do I optimize pricing?
- How do I handle no-shows?
- How do I compete with other slots?

**Feature ideas:**

1. **Dynamic pricing** (High impact)
   - Auto-adjust price based on demand
   - "Earn 40% more with smart pricing"
   - Implementation: 3 weeks

2. **Automated responses** (Low impact)
   - Auto-confirm bookings
   - Auto-cancel no-shows
   - Implementation: 1 week

3. **Performance dashboard** (Medium impact)
   - Revenue trends
   - Booking patterns
   - Competitor pricing
   - Implementation: 2 weeks

**ROI calculation:**
- Dynamic pricing: 40% revenue increase for owners → 40% more fees for you
- Automated responses: Saves 2 hrs/week → retention tool
- Dashboard: No direct revenue, but reduces churn

### The Decision Framework

For each feature, ask:

1. **Does it increase revenue?** (Transaction value or volume)
2. **Does it reduce churn?** (Keep customers longer)
3. **Does it reduce costs?** (Support, hosting, etc.)
4. **Does it enable expansion?** (New markets, new customers)

**Score each: High (3), Medium (2), Low (1), None (0)**

| Feature | Revenue | Churn | Costs | Expansion | Total |
|---------|---------|-------|-------|-----------|-------|
| Instant booking | 3 | 2 | 0 | 1 | 6 |
| Guest booking | 2 | 1 | 0 | 3 | 6 |
| Recurring | 3 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 6 |
| Dynamic pricing | 3 | 2 | 0 | 2 | 7 |
| Automated responses | 0 | 2 | 1 | 0 | 3 |
| Dashboard | 0 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 2 |

**Verdict:** Build dynamic pricing first. Highest score.

**⚡ ACTION ITEM:** Score your top 10 feature ideas.
Only build top 3.

## 🏗️ Part 5: Architecture Evolution - When to Rebuild?

### The Monolith You Have Now

```
Next.js App (Single Deployment)
├── Frontend (React)
├── API Routes (Node.js)
├── Auth (Supabase)
└── Database (PostgreSQL)
```

**Pros:**
- Simple to develop
- Simple to deploy
- Low latency (everything colocated)

**Cons:**
- Can't scale components independently
- Can't use different tech stacks
- One bug can crash everything

### The Microservices You Might Need

**When?** When ONE component becomes the bottleneck.

**Example:** Pricing algorithm is complex, CPU-intensive

```
Next.js Frontend ←→ API Gateway ←→ Services
                                    ├── Auth Service (Node.js)
                                    ├── Booking Service (Node.js)
                                    ├── Pricing Service (Python + ML)
                                    ├── Notification Service (Node.js)
                                    └── Analytics Service (Go)
```

**Pros:**
- Scale services independently
- Use best tech for each job (Python for ML, Go for analytics)
- Team can work on different services without conflicts

**Cons:**
- 10x complexity (service discovery, API versioning, etc.)
- Network latency between services
- Distributed debugging nightmare

**The Rule:** Don't go microservices until you have:
1. A clear bottleneck that can't be solved with vertical scaling
2. A team of 10+ engineers (need dedicated DevOps)
3. Revenue to justify the complexity ($500k+ MRR)

### The Real Decision: What to Extract First?

**Candidate 1: Notifications**
- Independent from core booking flow
- Can fail without breaking core app
- Easy to extract

```typescript
// Before: In Next.js API route
await sendBookingConfirmation(booking)

// After: Message queue
await queue.publish('booking.confirmed', booking)
// Notification service listens to queue
```

**Candidate 2: Analytics**
- Separate database (don't slow down OLTP)
- Can use different tech (ClickHouse, BigQuery)
- Batch jobs, not real-time

```typescript
// Before: Analytics queries on main DB
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM bookings WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'

// After: Analytics database (synced via CDC)
// Queries on analytics DB don't affect app performance
```

**Candidate 3: Pricing**
- CPU intensive (if using ML)
- Might need GPU (if complex models)
- Isolated domain logic

```typescript
// Before: In booking route
const price = calculatePrice(slot, start, end)

// After: Pricing service
const price = await pricingService.getPrice({ slotId, start, end })
```

**⚡ ACTION ITEM:** Don't extract anything until:
- App is consistently slow (> 500ms p95)
- You've tried caching, DB optimization, etc.
- You have monitoring to prove the bottleneck

---

## 📊 Part 6: Data Strategy - The Asset You're Building

### What Data Do You Actually Have?

**Current schema captures:**
- Who books what, when
- Pricing per slot
- User contact info

**What's MISSING that's valuable:**

1. **Behavioral data**
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE user_events (
     id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
     user_id UUID,
     event_type TEXT,  -- viewed_slot, searched, filtered, etc.
     event_data JSONB,
     created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
   );
   ```

2. **Market data**
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE external_events (
     id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
     event_type TEXT,  -- concert, sports_game, holiday
     venue TEXT,
     date DATE,
     expected_impact TEXT,  -- high, medium, low
     created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
   );
   ```

3. **Performance data**
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE slot_performance (
     slot_id INT,
     date DATE,
     views INT,
     bookings INT,
     revenue DECIMAL(10,2),
     avg_price DECIMAL(10,2),
     PRIMARY KEY (slot_id, date)
   );
   ```

### The Data Products You Can Build

#### Product 1: Market Insights (Sell to property managers)
```
"Your parking revenue could be 35% higher"
Based on:
- Competitor pricing
- Seasonal demand
- Event correlation
```

**Monetization:** $500/month per property

#### Product 2: Demand Forecasting (Sell to owners)
```
"List your slot 2 weeks in advance for upcoming concert"
Based on:
- Historical event data
- Booking patterns
- Price elasticity
```

**Monetization:** Premium feature, $20/month

#### Product 3: Anonymized Benchmarks (Free, to attract customers)
```
"Properties like yours earn $12,000/month from parking"
Based on:
- Aggregated data across all properties
- Public benchmarks
```

**Monetization:** Lead generation

**⚡ ACTION ITEM:** Start capturing event data NOW.
Even if you don't use it yet, you'll need historical data later.

## 🌍 Part 7: Scaling Scenarios - "What If?"

### Scenario 1: 10x Users Overnight

**Trigger:** TikTok video goes viral, "How I make $3k/month renting my parking spot"

**What breaks:**

1. **Database connections exhausted**
   - PostgreSQL default: 100 connections
   - Each Next.js request = 1 connection
   - 1000 concurrent users = 🔥

   **Fix:** Connection pooling
   ```typescript
   // Before
   const supabase = createClient()

   // After
   const supabase = createClient({
     db: {
       pooling: {
         max: 20,
         min: 5,
         idleTimeoutMillis: 30000
       }
     }
   })
   ```

2. **Supabase rate limits hit**
   - Free tier: 50k requests/day
   - Viral traffic: 500k requests/day
   - Result: 503 errors

   **Fix:** Caching layer
   ```typescript
   // Redis cache
   const cachedSlots = await redis.get('available_slots')
   if (cachedSlots) return JSON.parse(cachedSlots)

   const { data } = await supabase.from('parking_slots').select('*')
   await redis.setex('available_slots', 60, JSON.stringify(data))
   ```

3. **Vercel function timeout (10s free tier)**
   - Complex queries take >10s
   - Functions get killed mid-query

   **Fix:** Move to background jobs
   ```typescript
   // Before: Inline in API route
   await sendBookingConfirmations()

   // After: Background job
   await queue.publish('send_confirmations', { booking_ids })
   ```

### Scenario 2: International Expansion

**Trigger:** Condos in Singapore, London, Dubai want ParkBoard

**New challenges:**

1. **Multi-currency**
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE parking_slots
   ADD COLUMN currency TEXT DEFAULT 'PHP';

   ALTER TABLE bookings
   ADD COLUMN currency TEXT,
   ADD COLUMN exchange_rate DECIMAL(10,4);
   ```

2. **Multi-timezone**
   ```typescript
   // Wrong: Assumes user timezone = server timezone
   const startTime = new Date(req.body.start_time)

   // Right: Store in UTC, display in user timezone
   const startTime = new Date(req.body.start_time)
   const utcStartTime = new Date(startTime.toISOString())
   ```

3. **Multi-language**
   ```typescript
   // i18n library
   import { useTranslation } from 'next-i18next'

   const { t } = useTranslation()
   <h1>{t('welcome_message')}</h1>

   // en.json: "welcome_message": "Welcome to ParkBoard"
   // es.json: "welcome_message": "Bienvenido a ParkBoard"
   ```

4. **Data residency (GDPR, local laws)**
   - EU data must stay in EU
   - China data must stay in China

   **Architecture:**
   ```
   Global Router (edge)
   ├── US Region (Vercel US)
   │   └── Supabase US
   ├── EU Region (Vercel EU)
   │   └── Supabase EU
   └── Asia Region (Vercel Singapore)
       └── Supabase Singapore
   ```

### Scenario 3: Enterprise Customer

**Trigger:** Ayala Land (100+ properties) wants ParkBoard

**Requirements that break everything:**

1. **SSO (Single Sign-On)**
   - "Our employees must login with their corp email"
   - Need: SAML/OAuth integration

2. **Custom SLA**
   - "99.99% uptime or we don't pay"
   - Need: Multi-region failover, 24/7 support

3. **On-premise deployment**
   - "We can't use your cloud, security policy"
   - Need: Dockerize everything, provide Helm charts

4. **Custom integrations**
   - "Must sync with our SAP system"
   - Need: Flexible webhook/API architecture

5. **White-label to the extreme**
   - "No mention of ParkBoard anywhere"
   - Need: Completely themeable, custom domain

**Decision point:**

| Go Enterprise | Stay SMB |
|---------------|----------|
| + Huge contracts ($100k+/year) | + Simpler product |
| + Predictable revenue | + Faster iteration |
| + Market validation | + Lower support burden |
| - Slow sales cycle (6-12 months) | - Smaller deals ($1k-10k/year) |
| - Custom work (1:1 time) | - Higher churn |
| - Harder to pivot | - Need more customers |

**⚡ ACTION ITEM:** Decide your ICP (Ideal Customer Profile) NOW.
Can't serve both SMBs and enterprise well.

---

## 🔒 Part 8: The Uncomfortable Legal/Compliance Questions

### Question: Who's Liable When Things Go Wrong?

**Scenario 1: No-show nightmare**
```
Renter books slot for 2pm
Renter doesn't show up
Owner loses revenue
Owner sues ParkBoard for "guaranteed booking fraud"
```

**Your terms must cover:**
- Are bookings binding contracts?
- What's the cancellation policy?
- Who eats the cost of no-shows?

**Implementation impact:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE cancellation_policies (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  slot_id INT REFERENCES parking_slots(slot_id),
  cancel_before_hours INT,  -- 24 hours notice
  refund_percentage INT,    -- 100%, 50%, 0%
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

**Scenario 2: Parking spot doesn't exist**
```
Owner lists "Slot A-99"
Renter books it
Renter arrives, slot doesn't exist
Renter missed important meeting
Renter sues both owner and ParkBoard
```

**Protection mechanisms needed:**
- Owner verification (proof of ownership)
- Photo requirements (prove slot exists)
- Insurance/deposit system

**Scenario 3: Data breach**
```
Hacker gets into your database
Leaks: Names, phone numbers, unit numbers, parking patterns
News headline: "ParkBoard leak reveals when residents are home"
```

**GDPR/Privacy implications:**
- Right to deletion (can you truly delete everything?)
- Breach notification (24 hours to notify EU users)
- Data minimization (do you NEED to store all this?)

**⚠️ ACTION ITEM:** Talk to a lawyer BEFORE first paying customer.
Terms of Service aren't optional.

---

## 🎯 Part 9: The Strategic Roadmap - Your Forcing Function

### Month 1-3: Validate Core Hypothesis

**Hypothesis:** "Condo residents will pay for convenient parking"

**Metrics to prove/disprove:**
- 30% of residents create accounts
- 20% of residents list at least one slot
- 10% monthly active booking rate
- $500+ in monthly transactions

**If metrics FAIL, pivot to:**
- Enterprise sales (property managers, not residents)
- Different vertical (office buildings, hospitals)
- Different geography (US instead of PH)

### Month 4-6: Find Product-Market Fit

**Goal:** 3-5 condos, $10k MRR

**Experiments to run:**
1. **Pricing test**
   - A/B test: 10% vs 15% transaction fee
   - Which has better unit economics?

2. **Feature priority**
   - What do power users want most?
   - What would make them pay 2x more?

3. **Acquisition channel**
   - Facebook ads vs referrals vs partnerships
   - What's the CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost)?

### Month 7-12: Scale What Works

**Goal:** 20+ condos, $50k MRR

## 🚀 Part 11: The Next 30 Days - Forcing Function

### Week 1: Customer Discovery (Again)

Talk to 10 potential customers. Ask:

1. "Show me the last time you struggled with parking"
2. "How much would you pay to solve this?"
3. "What's stopping you from using ParkBoard today?"

**Output:** Customer pain ranking (1-10) for each feature

### Week 2: Metric Instrumentation

Add analytics to everything:

```typescript
// Every user action
analytics.track('slot_viewed', {
  slot_id,
  user_id,
  source: 'browse' | 'search' | 'direct'
})

analytics.track('booking_started', { slot_id, user_id })
analytics.track('booking_completed', { booking_id, revenue })
analytics.track('booking_cancelled', { booking_id, reason })
```

**Output:** Dashboard showing funnel conversion

### Week 3: Pick ONE Big Bet

From all the ideas in this doc, pick ONE to build this month.

**Criteria:**
- Can be shipped in 2 weeks
- Will 2x a key metric (revenue, retention, acquisition)
- You're 80% confident it will work

**Examples:**
- Dynamic pricing (2x revenue)
- Guest booking (2x users)
- Condo manager dashboard (unlock enterprise)

### Week 4: Ship It & Measure

Build, deploy, measure results.

**If it works:** Double down, do it again
**If it fails:** Kill it fast, try something else

## 🔥 Final Challenge

Most founders fail because they build what they CAN build, not what they SHOULD build.

**Your challenge:** For every feature idea, ask:

1. "Does this get me closer to Product-Market Fit?"
2. "Would I pay 2x more for this feature?"
3. "Can this be a $100M business component?"

If the answer to all three isn't "YES", don't build it.

**Now go forth and build something people actually want.** 🚀
