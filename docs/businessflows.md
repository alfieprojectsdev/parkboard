Here‚Äôs a clean, high-altitude view of the **business flows ParkBoard will eventually need** ‚Äî broken down so you can see where you‚Äôre solid and where you‚Äôve got blind spots. I grouped them by **actor** and flow type so you can map them onto features later.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Integration / Growth Flows (future)

* **3rd-party analytics or facility-management suites**

#### üß≠ Recommendations

* **Separate MVP vs. later:** keep MVP to *Resident Flows* + a slim Admin panel.
* **Design for growth:** even if you don‚Äôt build payments or IoT now, leave space in the schema (e.g., `payment_status`, `device_id`).
* **Write acceptance criteria:** one per flow so testing stays focused.
* **Map flows to data tables:** ensures schema supports everything (e.g., slot\_status history, audit logs).

Would you like me to sketch a **priority matrix** (MVP / phase 2 / future) for these flows so you can see where to focus next?
