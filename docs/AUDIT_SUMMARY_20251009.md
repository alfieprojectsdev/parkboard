# ParkBoard MVP - Quick Audit Summary

**Branch:** `parkboard-mvp-optimized` ✅
**Date:** 2025-10-07
**Status:** 95% Complete - 1 blocker remaining

---

## ✅ Confirmed Working

### Security (ALL FIXED)
- ✅ Schema uses `status` field (not `is_available`)
- ✅ Client does NOT send `total_price` to database
- ✅ Database trigger calculates price server-side
- ✅ Middleware protects all routes
- ✅ RLS policies optimized (no subqueries)

### Performance (ALL IMPLEMENTED)
- ✅ `slot_owner_id` denormalized in bookings
- ✅ Composite indexes added
- ✅ Covering index for marketplace
- ✅ `updated_at` columns on all tables
- ✅ Auto-update triggers configured

### Architecture (COMPLETE)
- ✅ All database constraints exist
- ✅ All triggers functioning
- ✅ All helper functions created
- ✅ Optimized schema ready (`schema_optimized.sql`)

## 🔴 Critical Blocker

**Landing Page Not Customized**
- Location: `app/page.tsx`
- Issue: Still shows Next.js boilerplate
- Tests failing: TEST-R001 (all 4 assertions)
- Fix time: ~2 hours
- **THIS BLOCKS MVP LAUNCH**

---

## 🟡 Recommendations

### Delete These Files:
```bash
rm app/test/page.tsx  # Test file not needed
```

### Use This Schema:
```bash
# Deploy to Supabase:
db/schema_optimized.sql  # ✅ Use this (has all optimizations)
# NOT: db/schema_refined.sql (outdated)
```

## 📊 Testing Status

**Framework:** ✅ Jest + React Testing Library installed
**Config:** ✅ `jest.config.js` and `jest.setup.js` created
**Scripts:** ✅ `npm test`, `npm run test:watch`, `npm run test:coverage`

**Tests Created:**
- ✅ `__tests__/routes/landing.test.tsx` (failing - needs page fix)
- ✅ `__tests__/components/AuthWrapper.test.tsx` (stub)
- ✅ `__tests__/components/Navigation.test.tsx` (passing)
- ✅ `__tests__/utils/price-calculation.test.ts` (passing 5/5)

**Coverage:** 4 P0 test stubs created (need expansion)
