# 📋 Next Steps - Actual Deployment

The codebase is now production-ready, but you need to
complete the Vercel deployment yourself. Here's your roadmap:
1. Create Vercel Account (5 minutes)
# Go to: https://vercel.com/signup
# Sign up with GitHub (recommended)
2. Import Project to Vercel (3 minutes)
- Click "Add New..." → "Project"
- Search for alfieprojectsdev/parkboard
- Click "Import"
- Configure:
  - Framework: Next.js (auto-detected)
  - Root Directory: ./
  - Build Command: npm run build (default)
3. Add Environment Variables (5 minutes)
In Vercel Dashboard → Project Settings → Environment
Variables:
Production Environment:
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://cgbkknefvggnhkvmuwsa.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=[get from Supabase Dashboard]
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=[get from Supabase Dashboard]
Get these from: Supabase Dashboard → Project Settings → API
4. Deploy (1 click)
- Vercel will automatically deploy after adding env vars
- Wait 2-3 minutes for build
- You'll get a URL like: parkboard.vercel.app
5. Configure Custom Domain (10 minutes)
In Vercel → Domains → Add parkboard.app:
- Add A record to Porkbun DNS: @ → 76.76.21.21
- Add CNAME record: www → cname.vercel-dns.com
- Wait 5-30 minutes for DNS propagation
- Vercel auto-issues SSL certificate
6. Run Production Migrations (5 minutes)
IMPORTANT: Run these in Supabase SQL Editor before going
live:
# In Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor, run these files:
db/migrations/002_multi_tenant_communities_idempotent.sql
db/migrations/003_community_rls_policies_idempotent.sql

🎯 Current Status
- Codebase: ✅ Production-ready
- Build: ✅ Succeeds
- Tests: ✅ Passing
- Commits: ✅ Up to date
- Vercel Setup: ⏳ Waiting for you
- Domain: ⏳ Waiting for deployment
- Migrations: ⏳ Need to run in production DB
You're ~30 minutes away from going live! 🚀
Would you like me to help with anything specific about the
deployment process, or should we move on to another task?
