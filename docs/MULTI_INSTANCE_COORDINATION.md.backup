## Overview

### The Problem

When multiple AI instances or developers work on parkboard simultaneously, coordination challenges arise:
- **Resource conflicts**: Two instances trying to use the same worktree
- **Port conflicts**: Multiple dev servers on the same port
- **Database conflicts**: Migrations running concurrently
- **Communication gaps**: No way to know what others are doing
- **Work duplication**: Two instances implementing the same feature

### The Solution

Git worktrees + Scratchpad communication + Instance assignment = **Parallelized development without conflicts**

### Key Principles

1. **One worktree per instance** - No sharing, no conflicts
2. **Explicit communication** - All instances read/write to scratchpads
3. **Port isolation** - Each instance has assigned ports
4. **State visibility** - Lock files show who's working on what
5. **Automated checks** - Scripts prevent conflicts before they happen

---

## Instance Assignment Strategy

### Standard Instance Allocation

| Instance ID | Worktree | Branch | Port | Primary Role |
|-------------|----------|--------|------|--------------|
| `claude-main` | main | main | 3000 | Production testing, critical fixes |
| `claude-feature` | feature-slot-edit | feature/slot-edit | 3001 | Feature development |
| `claude-fix` | fix-sign-out-issues | fix/sign-out-issues | 3002 | Bug fixes |
| `claude-dev` | dev | main | 3003 | Experimentation, testing |
| `claude-test` | test | main | 3004 | E2E testing, QA |
| `claude-docs` | docs | main | 3005 | Documentation updates |

### Dynamic Instance Creation

For new tasks not fitting the standard allocation:

```bash
# Create new worktree for instance
./create-instance-worktree.sh <instance-id> <branch-name> <port>

# Example:
./create-instance-worktree.sh claude-ui feature/ui-redesign 3006
```

This creates:
- Worktree at `parkboard-worktrees/<instance-id>/`
- Lock file at `parkboard-worktrees/.locks/<instance-id>.lock`
- Scratchpad at `parkboard-worktrees/.scratchpads/<instance-id>.md`

---

## Communication Protocol

### Scratchpad Structure

Each instance maintains a scratchpad in `parkboard-worktrees/.scratchpads/<instance-id>.md`

**Scratchpad Template:**

```markdown
# Instance: <instance-id>
# Worktree: <worktree-name>
# Port: <port-number>
# Started: <timestamp>
# Last Updated: <timestamp>

---

## Current Status

**State:** [IDLE | WORKING | BLOCKED | COMPLETED | ERROR]
**Working On:** <brief description>
**Estimated Completion:** <timestamp or "unknown">

---

## Current Task

### Objective
<What is this instance trying to accomplish?>

### Progress
- [x] Completed step 1
- [ ] In progress: step 2
- [ ] Pending: step 3

### Blockers
- None

---

## Messages to Other Instances

### To: <target-instance-id> | ALL
**Priority:** [LOW | MEDIUM | HIGH | URGENT]
**Message:** <communication>

---

## Recent Commits

- `abc123` - feat: implemented feature X
- `def456` - fix: resolved issue Y

---

## Resources Locked

- Database: [YES | NO]
- Files: <list of files currently being edited>
- Migrations pending: [YES | NO]

---

## Notes

<Any additional context or observations>
```

### Communication Rules

1. **Update frequency**: Every significant state change (minimum every 15 minutes of active work)
2. **Read before write**: Always read all scratchpads before starting new work
3. **Priority messages**: Check for HIGH/URGENT messages every 5 minutes
4. **Acknowledgment**: Respond to direct messages within 10 minutes
5. **Completion notification**: Update status to COMPLETED when done

### Message Types

```markdown
### To: ALL
**Priority:** HIGH
**Message:** Starting database migration 004. Please do not run any DB operations for 5 minutes.

### To: claude-feature
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Message:** I've refactored AuthWrapper.tsx. You may need to update your imports.

### To: ALL
**Priority:** URGENT
**Message:** Critical bug found in slot booking. All instances please PAUSE work on booking-related features.
```

---

## Conflict Prevention

### Pre-Work Checklist

Before starting any work, each instance MUST:

1. **Read all scratchpads**
   ```bash
   cat parkboard-worktrees/.scratchpads/*.md
   ```

2. **Check lock files**
   ```bash
   ls -la parkboard-worktrees/.locks/
   ```

3. **Verify port availability**
   ```bash
   ./check-port.sh <my-port>
   ```

4. **Check for blocking messages**
   ```bash
   grep -r "Priority: URGENT" parkboard-worktrees/.scratchpads/
   ```

5. **Announce your intent**
   ```bash
   ./announce-task.sh "<task-description>"
   ```

### Lock File System

Lock files prevent concurrent work on the same resource.

**Lock File Format:** `parkboard-worktrees/.locks/<resource>.lock`

```json
{
  "resource": "database",
  "locked_by": "claude-main",
  "locked_at": "2025-10-18T10:30:00Z",
  "reason": "Running migration 004",
  "estimated_release": "2025-10-18T10:35:00Z"
}
```

**Lock Types:**

- `database.lock` - Database migrations or schema changes
- `env.lock` - Environment variable changes
- `package-json.lock` - Dependency updates
- `<file-path>.lock` - Specific file being edited

**Acquiring a lock:**

```bash
./acquire-lock.sh database "Running migration 004" "5 minutes"
```

**Releasing a lock:**

```bash
./release-lock.sh database
```

**Checking locks:**

```bash
./check-locks.sh
```

### File Conflict Prevention

Each instance should work on different files when possible. Use the scratchpad "Files" section:

```markdown
## Resources Locked

- Database: NO
- Files:
  - app/[community]/slots/page.tsx (editing)
  - components/slots/SlotCard.tsx (editing)
  - __tests__/routes/slots.test.tsx (editing)
- Migrations pending: NO
```

Other instances can see this and avoid those files.

---

## State Synchronization

### Pulling Updates

Each instance should periodically pull updates from other instances:

```bash
# Run this every 30 minutes or before starting new work
./sync-worktree.sh
```

This script:
1. Fetches from origin
2. Checks other worktrees for new commits
3. Notifies if merge conflicts might occur
4. Updates local branches

### Sharing Work in Progress

To share uncommitted work:

```bash
# Create a WIP branch
git checkout -b wip/<instance-id>/<feature-name>
git add .
git commit -m "WIP: <description>"
git push -u origin wip/<instance-id>/<feature-name>

# Notify others in scratchpad
```

Other instances can then:

```bash
# Pull WIP work
git fetch origin wip/<instance-id>/<feature-name>
git checkout wip/<instance-id>/<feature-name>
```

### Coordinated Commits

For features requiring multiple instances:

1. **Designate a coordinator** (usually claude-main)
2. **All instances push to feature branches**
3. **Coordinator reviews and merges**

Example workflow:

```markdown
## Coordinated Feature: UI Redesign

**Coordinator:** claude-main
**Participants:** claude-feature, claude-ui, claude-test

**Branches:**
- claude-feature: feature/ui-redesign-components
- claude-ui: feature/ui-redesign-styles
- claude-test: feature/ui-redesign-tests

**Merge Order:**
1. claude-feature → feature/ui-redesign
2. claude-ui → feature/ui-redesign
3. claude-test → feature/ui-redesign
4. feature/ui-redesign → main (after all tests pass)
```

## Automated Coordination

### Status Monitor Script

Create `parkboard-worktrees/monitor.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Continuous monitoring of all instances

watch -n 10 '
echo "=== PARKBOARD INSTANCE STATUS ==="
echo ""
for scratchpad in parkboard-worktrees/.scratchpads/*.md; do
  instance=$(basename "$scratchpad" .md)
  status=$(grep "State:" "$scratchpad" | cut -d" " -f2)
  task=$(grep "Working On:" "$scratchpad" | cut -d":" -f2-)
  echo "[$status] $instance: $task"
done
echo ""
echo "=== ACTIVE LOCKS ==="
ls -1 parkboard-worktrees/.locks/*.lock 2>/dev/null | xargs -I{} basename {} .lock
echo ""
echo "=== PORT STATUS ==="
for port in 3000 3001 3002 3003 3004 3005; do
  if lsof -ti:$port >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    echo "Port $port: BUSY"
  else
    echo "Port $port: FREE"
  fi
done
'
```

### Conflict Checker Script

Create `parkboard-worktrees/check-conflicts.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Check for potential conflicts before starting work

echo "Checking for conflicts..."

# Check if any instance is running migrations
if grep -r "Database: YES" parkboard-worktrees/.scratchpads/*.md; then
  echo "⚠️  WARNING: Another instance is using the database"
  exit 1
fi

# Check for urgent messages
if grep -r "Priority: URGENT" parkboard-worktrees/.scratchpads/*.md; then
  echo "🚨 URGENT MESSAGE FOUND:"
  grep -r "Priority: URGENT" -A 2 parkboard-worktrees/.scratchpads/*.md
  exit 1
fi

# Check for lock files
if ls parkboard-worktrees/.locks/*.lock 2>/dev/null; then
  echo "🔒 Active locks found:"
  for lock in parkboard-worktrees/.locks/*.lock; do
    cat "$lock"
  done
  exit 1
fi

echo "✅ No conflicts detected. Safe to proceed."
exit 0
```

### Auto-Update Script

Create `parkboard-worktrees/auto-sync.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Automatically sync all worktrees every 30 minutes

while true; do
  echo "[$(date)] Syncing worktrees..."

  for worktree in parkboard-worktrees/*/; do
    if [ -d "$worktree/.git" ]; then
      cd "$worktree"
      echo "Syncing $(basename $worktree)..."
      git fetch --all --quiet
      # Don't auto-pull, just fetch
    fi
  done

  echo "[$(date)] Sync complete. Next sync in 30 minutes."
  sleep 1800  # 30 minutes
done
```

## Instance Initialization Checklist

When a new Claude instance starts work:

### Phase 1: Environment Setup (2 minutes)

- [ ] Identify your instance ID (e.g., `claude-feature`)
- [ ] Navigate to your assigned worktree
  ```bash
  cd /home/ltpt420/repos/parkboard-worktrees/<your-worktree>
  ```
- [ ] Verify dependencies are installed
  ```bash
  npm list 2>&1 | head -5
  ```
- [ ] Check your assigned port is free
  ```bash
  lsof -ti:<your-port> || echo "Port is free"
  ```

### Phase 2: Coordination Setup (3 minutes)

- [ ] Read ALL instance scratchpads
  ```bash
  cat /home/ltpt420/repos/parkboard-worktrees/.scratchpads/*.md
  ```
- [ ] Read shared scratchpad for alerts
  ```bash
  cat /home/ltpt420/repos/parkboard-worktrees/.scratchpads/shared.md
  ```
- [ ] Check for active locks
  ```bash

## Advanced Coordination Patterns

### Pattern 1: Handoff Between Instances

When one instance needs another to continue:

**Instance A (claude-feature):**
```markdown
## Messages to Other Instances

### To: claude-test
**Priority:** HIGH
**Message:** Feature complete on feature/hybrid-pricing-ui. Ready for E2E testing.
Branch pushed to origin. Tests needed for:
- Create slot with NULL price
- Display "Contact Owner" UI
- Prevent booking when price is NULL

Handoff at: 2025-10-18 14:30:00
```

**Instance B (claude-test):**
```markdown
## Current Status

**State:** WORKING
**Working On:** E2E tests for hybrid pricing (handoff from claude-feature)

## Messages to Other Instances

### To: claude-feature
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Message:** Tests received. Starting E2E implementation. ETA: 1 hour.
```

### Pattern 2: Coordinated Deployment

Multiple instances preparing for deployment:

**Coordinator (claude-main):**
```markdown
## Deployment Coordination: 2025-10-18 16:00

**Participants:**
- claude-feature: Merge feature branches
- claude-test: Run full E2E suite
- claude-docs: Update deployment docs
- claude-main: Execute deployment

**Timeline:**
- 15:00 - All instances freeze new work
- 15:15 - claude-test runs full suite
- 15:30 - claude-feature merges to main
- 15:45 - claude-main runs final checks
- 16:00 - DEPLOY

**Rollback Plan:**
- If E2E fails: Revert commits, delay 1 day
- If deployment fails: Rollback via Vercel dashboard
```

### Pattern 3: Emergency Stop

When critical bug discovered:

```markdown
# SHARED SCRATCHPAD - URGENT ALERT

## 🚨 EMERGENCY STOP 🚨

**Posted by:** claude-main
**Time:** 2025-10-18 11:45:00
**Severity:** CRITICAL

**Issue:** Production bug in slot booking - double charging users

**Action Required:**
- ❌ ALL instances STOP work on booking-related features
- ❌ DO NOT deploy anything to production
- ❌ DO NOT run database migrations
- ✅ claude-fix: Investigate and fix ASAP
- ✅ All others: Review code for similar issues

**Status:** INVESTIGATING
**ETA for fix:** Unknown

---

**Update 12:30:** Fix identified. Testing in progress.
**Update 13:00:** Fix deployed. All clear. Resume normal work.
```

---

## Best Practices

### Do's

✅ **Always read scratchpads before starting work**
✅ **Update your status frequently**
✅ **Commit small, focused changes**
✅ **Use descriptive commit messages**
✅ **Announce breaking changes immediately**
✅ **Respond to direct messages promptly**
✅ **Clean up locks when done**
✅ **Test before marking tasks complete**

### Don'ts

❌ **Never share worktrees between instances**
❌ **Never ignore URGENT messages**
❌ **Never run migrations without announcement**
❌ **Never push directly to main (use PRs)**
❌ **Never leave stale locks**
❌ **Never work on same files simultaneously**
❌ **Never assume others know your changes**

---

## Troubleshooting Multi-Instance Issues

### Issue: Two instances editing same file

**Detection:**
```bash
# Check if file is locked
ls parkboard-worktrees/.locks/components-slots-SlotCard.tsx.lock
```

**Solution:**
```markdown
### To: <other-instance>
**Priority:** HIGH
**Message:** I need to edit components/slots/SlotCard.tsx.
Can you complete your changes or can I take over?
```

### Issue: Port conflict

**Detection:**
```bash
lsof -ti:3001
# Shows PID if port is busy
```

**Solution:**
```bash
# Find which instance is using it
ps aux | grep <PID>

# Contact that instance via scratchpad
# Or use your alternate port
npm run dev -- -p 3011
```

### Issue: Database migration conflict

**Prevention:**
```bash
# Always acquire lock before migrations
./acquire-lock.sh database "Running migration 005" "10 minutes"

# Announce in shared scratchpad
echo "### ALERT: Running migration 005" >> shared.md
```

---

## Metrics and Monitoring

### Track Coordination Effectiveness

Create `parkboard-worktrees/metrics.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Generate coordination metrics

echo "=== COORDINATION METRICS ==="
echo ""

# Active instances
echo "Active Instances: $(grep -l 'State: WORKING' parkboard-worktrees/.scratchpads/*.md | wc -l)"

# Tasks completed today
echo "Tasks Completed Today: $(grep -c "$(date +%Y-%m-%d)" parkboard-worktrees/.coordination/task-board.md || echo 0)"

# Average response time to messages
echo "Open Messages: $(grep -c 'To:.*Priority:' parkboard-worktrees/.scratchpads/*.md)"

# Lock conflicts (same lock requested multiple times)
echo "Lock Conflicts: $(ls parkboard-worktrees/.locks/*.lock 2>/dev/null | wc -l)"

# Commits per instance
echo ""
echo "Commits per instance:"
for worktree in parkboard-worktrees/*/; do
  cd "$worktree"
  instance=$(basename "$worktree")
  commits=$(git log --since="today" --oneline | wc -l)
  echo "  $instance: $commits commits"
done
```

---

## Summary

Multi-instance coordination transforms parallel development from chaotic to systematic:

**Without Coordination:**
- Constant merge conflicts
- Duplicate work
- Resource contention
- Communication chaos

**With Coordination:**
- Clear ownership
- No conflicts
- Efficient parallelization
- Transparent communication

**Key Success Factors:**
1. Strict adherence to scratchpad protocol
2. Proactive lock management
3. Frequent status updates
4. Responsive communication
5. Automated conflict detection
